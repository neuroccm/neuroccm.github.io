A proportion of patients wake up with a stroke and it is believed that in a significant fraction of these patients, the stroke occurs close to the waking hour.  Such patients, are traditionally excluded from thrombolytic treatment given that they are outside of the standard window for delivery of TPA, this being 4.5 hours (i.e. last seen normal beyond 4.5 hrs).

In a study published in May in the New England Journal, the authors of the WAKE-UP trial, tested a hypothesis that some of these patients can be candidates for TPA, when guided by MRI imaging, specifically mismatch between DWI and FLAIR.

The researchers discovered that in patients who received TPA, they had an increased chance of a favorable outcome (mRS 0-1), at 90 days.  Indeed, this was the first positive trial for IV thrombolysis and strokes of unknown time, however there are many important aspects to the study to consider.

Nonetheless, studies such as WAKE-UP, emphasize the notion that when identifying brain tissue at risk/ammenable to being saved, its less about time and more about the state of the underlying tissue.  In other words, are we attempt to understand more about areas of brain at risk versus areas that have completed infarction, the science is leading us to think about tissue health (perfusion, cellular energentics) rather than time windows based on the clinical history.

In this study, 503 suitable imaging results, were randomly assigned to alteplase or placebo, and most of the patient's in the study had mild to moderate strokes.  Primary endpoint was favorable outcome mRS at 90 days of 0 or 1. This occurred 53.3% (TPA) vs. 41.8% (Placebo group) - (adjusted odds ratio, 1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09 ­ 2.36; p = .02). It is important to note that this trial stopped early due to funding.

It is important to note that there was a trend towards increased mortality in the TPA group, but that it did not achieve statistical significance (4.1% vs. 1.2%, p=0.07). Of the 10 patients that died, 4 were due to symptomatic ICH. Rate of parenchymal hemorrhage type 2 was 4% vs 0.4% (p=0.03).

Challenges in implementation include the fact that obtaining MRI imaging in a timely manner is difficult and most centers. Also a large proportion of the patients in this trial were also eligible for EVT as per DAWN and DIFFUSE3 criteria  - approximately 20% of patients, which raises the possibility (unknown) of better outcome with EVT vs. late-window TPA administration.

Taken together, the findings of WAKE-UP push the boundaries of TPA administration in acute stroke care. For now, my personal opinion (comfort) is to stay within the ascribed 4.5hrs (reserving out of window TPA for special circumstances, off-lable with open disclosure to the patient/SDM). It's great however that such studies exist providing additional scientific basis for out of window TPA.

Below I have linked to the paper (imaging-based) where the scientific rational for looking beyond 4.5hrs comes from in way of DWI FLAIR mismatch.

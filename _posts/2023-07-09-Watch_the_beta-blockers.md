I tweeted about this previously - did not get much traction :)
I am sure someone will go ahead and prove this in a trial or looking back at the data.
Nonetheless, my clinical observation has been that the presence of beta-blockers, used for another indication (e.g. HTN), lowers the probability of detecting A Fib in a patient that presents with ESUS. Therefore, given the results of the recent ARCADIA trial [read more here](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/992525), there is a suggestion that some markers of atrialcardiopathy are not sufficient to detect the propensity of identifying those that may benefit from anticoagulation. However, I suspect, the presence of BBs also modulates the detection of A Fib, and those with LA dilatation (best via the LAVI, volume index), and embolic stroke, who are on BB, I suspect these patients actually have a high probability of A fib, and thus the search should be on to find it. BB can reduce the probability of detection - I cannot find any paper that show this - but I have found this to be the case clinically over and over again. There is some biologic plausability. Here is some "smoke" looking at the HR distributions with BB on-board, [see this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9996284/). The awesome point about this paper and other papers that are cited here are the fact that they show the complexity that we have with A Fib and how it is more than just atriopathy, but certainly involves HFpEF, chronic HTN, size and shape of the LAA, time in/out of A Fib, and even how medications used for HTN can modify intra-cardiac pressues to promote the development of A Fib - the cool-factor is that it is very intriguing and shows how no algebreic simple score can capture true risk of A Fib and risk of stroke from A Fib, as always, our models are approximations to what actually occures in nature. I am sure we will see more on this topic in the future!

Computing!
Oh my how things have changed over the past few months.
ChatGPT, GPT4 model, and the continuous improvements with VSCode, and implementation of GPT4 as co-pilot (limited to code).
Overall these have been very positive developments.
Also, as a lab colleague showed me - Docker! Game changer - what an excellent concept to virtualize key components of dependencies in containers and be able to run them fast and efficiently, at fairly low-level, without the usual drag of virtualization.

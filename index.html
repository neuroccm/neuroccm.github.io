    <p>Welcome to neuroccm.org â€“ developed by Houman Khosravani,  MD PhD FRCPC. I am an internist/intensivist who is passionate about neurocritical care, critical care medicine, and computer science. This site is dedicated to fostering learning, discussion, and interest in all things neurocritical care/critical care in addition to topics related to fields such as computational science/neuroscience, neurology, neurophysiology as they apply to these disciplines.</p>
    
    <p>Topics and posts discussed on this site are by no means the end-all or definitive write-up of a topic, but rather represent a perspective of a critical care physician/neuroscientist. If you are interest in contributing to neuroccm.org as a contributing author for blog posts, then please contact me: hk[at]ecriticalcare[dot]org.</p>

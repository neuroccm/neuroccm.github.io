    <p>Welcome to neuroccm.org â€“ developed by Houman Khosravani,  MD PhD FRCPC. I am an internist/intensivist who is passionate neurocritical care and computation. This site is dedicated to fostering learning, discussion, and interest in all things critical care and neurocritical care. In addition topics related to fields such as neurology, neuroscience, neurophysiology, and computation as they apply to critical care and neurocritical care will be referenced.</p>
    
    <p>Topics and posts discussed on this site are by no means the end-all or definitive write-up of a topic, but rather represent a perspective of a critical care physician/neuroscientist with an interest in neurocritical care. If you are interest in contributing to neuroccm.org as a contributing author/faculty, then please contact me: hk[at]ecriticalcare[dot]org.</p>

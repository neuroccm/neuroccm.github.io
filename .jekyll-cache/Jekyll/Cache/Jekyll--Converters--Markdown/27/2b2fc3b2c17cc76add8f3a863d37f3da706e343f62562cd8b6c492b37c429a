<p>Welcome to <a href="https://ncrit.org">ncrit.org/neuroccm.org</a> by Houman Khosravani. This site is a work in development and dedicated to fostering interest and discussion about topics in stroke neurology, neurocritical care/critical care EEG and my research on Quality Improvement.</p>

<p>My academic areas of interest are Quality Improvement in Stroke, and overlap with Neurocritical Care (such as care of the post-TPA and EVT patient); currently I am working on door-to-needle times and leveraging this QI work to enhance acute stroke care pathways. In the ICU my interest lies in <em>status epilepticus</em> and continuous EEG (cEEG). Regarding <em>status epilepticus</em>, I am specifically interested in <a href="https://norseinstitute.org">New-onset Refractory Status Epilepticus (NORSE)</a>.  In addition I am building collaborations and seeking collaborators interested in computational advances using machine learning as applied to the delivery of care in acute stroke and neurocritical care, in addition to signal processing of EEG.</p>

<p>Links, topics, and posts discussed on this site are by no means the end-all or definitive write-up of a topic and do not reflect anything other than personal opinion and perspective (of a critical care physician/neuroscientist). If you are interest in collaborating or contributing to neuroccm.org as a contributing author - please contact me: houman[at]ccmd[dot]io</p>

<p><strong>About</strong>
I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Toronto, Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine. I completed my undergraduate studies at York University, majoring in Biology-Astronomy and earning a BSc(Hon). This was followed by an MSc in Physiology under the supervision of Dr. Peter Carlen. My research focused on applying dynamical systems theory to seizure genesis in in vitro models of epilepsy. I then pursued MD/PhD studies (leaders in medicine program) at the University of Calgary, where I worked with Drs. Gerald Zamponi and Paolo Federico. Our work centered on T-type Ca+2 channels and Prion proteins, exploring their roles as modulators of neuronal excitability in epilepsy. We were the first to describe gain-of-function mutations in T-Type channels associated with primary generalized epilepsy. Additionally, we discovered that endogenous prion protein tonically inhibits a subtype of NMDA channels. This finding suggests that their removal in the PrP(Sc) form likely contributes to neuronal death through this and other pathways. My PhD also had a clinical component: I studied high-frequency oscillations in the intracranial EEG of epilepsy patients. Following my PhD and MD training, I completed a residency in Neurology (PGY1-2), transitioned to Internal Medicine (PGY3), and then underwent fellowship training in Adult Critical Care (PGY4-PGY5). I subsequently completed two additional fellowships: one in Neurocritical Care and EEG, and another in Stroke. My academic interests include quality improvement in stroke health systems, human performance factors, simulation in acute medicine, and palliative care in clinical neurosciences. I am passionate about using mobile technology and machine learning to enhance the quality of healthcare delivery. My lab is dedicated to Quality Improvement (QI) in acute stroke care, with a focus on several key areas.</p>

<ul>
  <li>stroke resuscitation - our lab termed the work ‚Äústroke resuscitation‚Äù, developed the protected code stroke protocol (endorsed and integrated in intranational guidelines during covid19), defined the use of crisis resource management in stroke, and thus our focus is education and quality improvement during the code stroke process. We use CRM pricinples and have an active code stroke simulation program. This also includes our efforts within NICE (Neurovascular Innovations CollaborativE) as listed below.</li>
  <li>AI4QI - machine learning for bolstering current standards of care. We are leveraging machine-learning to enhance QI within acute stroke care in the inpatient setting. Checkout the lab website <a href="https://uoftneurology.github.io"><strong>AI4QI</strong></a>.</li>
  <li>palliaitve care in acute stroke - we are passionate about providing maximal effective care and that includes integration of palliative care within stroke treatment; our lab works on the development of protocols for routine integration of palliative care as we define the scope of palliative medicine in acute stroke care.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Neurovascular Resuscitation - Neurovascular Innovations CollaborativE (NICE)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Our lab championed the framework of crisis resource management in stroke simulation to optimize critical intervention metrics such as ‚Äúdoor-to-needle‚Äù times. We are proud to be pioneers in the field and we published the first reframe of Crisis Resource Management (CRM) for stroke care care. We alsp developed the ‚Äúprotected code stroke‚Äù during the COVID19 pandemic, which was integrated into national and international guidelines, and downloaded over 27K times from the American Heart Association, Stroke journal‚Äôs website. Our research aims to enhance care pathways and human performance factors for acute stroke patients through simulation of neurovascular resuscitation. We have introduced the concept of ‚Äúneurovascular resuscitation,‚Äù applying principles from medical and trauma resuscitation to stroke treatment - thereby reinstating the ‚Äòcode‚Äô in code stroke.</li>
  <li>In 2023, Dr. Houman Khosravani and Dr. Christine Hawkes co-founded the Neurovascular Innovations CollaborativE (NICE), an initiative projected to contribute substantially to augmenting neurovascular care education.</li>
  <li>Our lab‚Äôs portion of focus is the medical/neurocritical care efforts within NICE, while Dr. Hawkes helms the neurovascular and catheter-based aspects of hyperacute care and techniques.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence 4 Quality Improvement (AI4QI) and the Neurology Quality and Innovations Lab (NQIL)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>We are also exploring the intersection of machine learning and quality improvement, utilizing voice-based technologies to refine our methods. We have expertise in deep-learning and processing of audio signals.</li>
  <li>Our pursuit of excellence extends to the cutting-edge field of machine learning. With support from T-CAIREM and SHSC, we are leveraging bedside physiologic recordings to improve the quality of acute stroke care.</li>
  <li>We are proud to have founded several initiatives, including the Neurology Quality and Innovations Lab (NQIL), in collaboration with Drs. Sara Mitchell and Charles Kassardjian.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Routine Integration of Palliative Care in Stroke</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Despite significant advancements in stroke care, a considerable number of patients still grapple with substantial morbidity and mortality. Recognizing this, we advocate for the routine integration of palliative care into stroke treatment. Compassionate and effective care forms the bedrock of the philosophy we advocate for in terms of expanding the confluence of palliative medicine and stroke care.</li>
</ul>

We look forward to advancing stroke care together.</p>

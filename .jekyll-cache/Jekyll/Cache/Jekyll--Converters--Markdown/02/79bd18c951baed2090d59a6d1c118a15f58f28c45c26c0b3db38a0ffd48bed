      <td>Welcome to the Stroke Innovations Lab</td>
      <td>AI4QI Lab in Stroke; Dr. Khosravani‚Äôs lab site, as part of the Division of Neurology at the University of Toronto. Our lab‚Äôs work is dedicated to Quality Improvement (QI) in acute stroke care. Our work focuses on several areas: 1) stroke resuscitation - our lab termed the work ‚Äústroke resuscitation‚Äù, developed the protected code stroke protocol, defined the use of crisis resource management in stroke, and thus our focus is education and quality improvement during the code stroke process. We use CRM pricinples and have an active code stroke simulation program. 2) we are passionate about providing maximal effective care and that includes integration of palliative care within stroke treatment; our lab works on the development of protocols for routine integration of palliative care as we define the scope of palliative medicine in acute stroke care. Fainally, 3) we are leveraging machine-learning to enhance QI within stroke care.</td>

<p><strong>Neurovascular Resuscitation - Neurovascular Innovations CollaborativE (NICE)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Our lab championed the framework of crisis resource management in stroke simulation to optimize critical intervention metrics such as ‚Äúdoor-to-needle‚Äù times. We are proud to be pioneers in the field and we published the first reframe of Crisis Resource Management (CRM) for stroke care care. We alsp developed the ‚Äúprotected code stroke‚Äù during the COVID19 pandemic, which was integrated into national and international guidelines, and downloaded over 27K times from the American Heart Association, Stroke journal‚Äôs website. Our research aims to enhance care pathways and human performance factors for acute stroke patients through simulation of neurovascular resuscitation. We have introduced the concept of ‚Äúneurovascular resuscitation,‚Äù applying principles from medical and trauma resuscitation to stroke treatment - thereby reinstating the ‚Äòcode‚Äô in code stroke.</li>
  <li>Dr. Khosravani and Dr. Christine Hawkes co-founded the Neurovascular Innovations CollaborativE (NICE), an initiative projected to contribute substantially to augmenting neurovascular care education.</li>
  <li>Our lab‚Äôs portion of focus is the medical/neurocritical care efforts within NICE, while Dr. Hawkes helms the neurovascular and catheter-based aspects of hyperacute care and techniques.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence 4 QI (AI4QI) and the Neurology Quality and Innovations Lab (NQIL)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>We are also exploring the intersection of machine learning and quality improvement, utilizing voice-based technologies to refine our methods.</li>
  <li>Our pursuit of excellence extends to the cutting-edge field of machine learning. Collaborating with T-CAIREM and SHSC, we are leveraging bedside physiologic recordings to improve the quality of acute stroke care.</li>
  <li>We are proud to have founded several initiatives, including the Neurology Quality and Innovations Lab (NQIL), in collaboration with Drs. Sara Mitchell and Charles Kassardjian.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Routine Integration of Palliative Care in Stroke</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Despite significant advancements in stroke care, a considerable number of patients still grapple with substantial morbidity and mortality. Recognizing this, we advocate for the routine integration of palliative care into stroke treatment. Compassionate and effective care forms the bedrock of the philosophy we advocate for in terms of expanding the confluence of palliative medicine and stroke care.</li>

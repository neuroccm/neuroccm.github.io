# Current Research and Academic Projects

*My current areas of active research/academic work are the following:*

# Extubation Pathway – extubate.ecriticalcare.org

There are many excellent airway management strategies, checklists, and guidelines. The same cannot be said about extubation pathways and preparedness for acute extubation failure in general medical/surgical ICUs. I am working with Dr. John Fuller at Western University where we have developed and evidence-informed extubation pathway that can be utilized by Respiratory Therapists to assist in safe extubation practices. We are studying extubation safety pre- and post- pathway introduction to assess its impact on aspects of patient safety.

# Medical Education – eCriticalCare.org - Junior/off-service resident education in the intensive care unit

For a full description of this project, please see eCriticalCare.org (see Education and ICU Boot Camp).
The ICU rotation for junior and off-service residents can be challenging in many ways. These include: ICU as a complex environment with multiple teams and multi-modal monitoring, there are competing schedules (call,vacation,teaching schedules), there are different knowledge gaps and starting points for the residents, and there is significant anxiety associated with managing acute situations and procedures.
We developed ICU Boot Camp as a course and mobile-platform using Google Classroom for students so that they can start their rotation ready to start taking care of critically-ill patients.

# NORSE (New Onset Refractory Status Epilepticus)

* Neuroimaging Research

Working with Drs. Teneille Gofton (Neuocritical care/Neurology), Manas Sharma (Neuroradiology), and Ali Khan (Imaging Science, Robarts Research Institute), we are developing means to analyze and characterize MRI changes in patients with refractory status epilepticus of unknown ethology, classified as NORSE.

* Advocacy - NORSEINSTITUTE.ORG

As part of a group including: Nora Wong, Nicolas Gaspard, Lawrence Hirsch, Teneille Gofton, and Emily Gilmore we are forming the NORSE Institute for patient advocacy, physician/research education, and overall awareness of NORSE. Stay tuned – check norseinstitute.org for updates.

# Future Directions

I am interested in the interface between computational solutions and medical challenges in caring for acute medically-ill and critically-ill patients. If you are a Principle Investigator with a computational focus and seek a clinical partner to work on such initiatives please do not hesitate to contact me.

The following are podcasts recorded for educational purposes. I will be adding content that is already developed over the past several years, including ICU Boot Camp series, an interview series with Dr. Martin Chapman (Neurointensivist at Sunnybrook Health Science) for TBI, in addition to podcasts for the NORSE Institute dealing with status epilepticus.

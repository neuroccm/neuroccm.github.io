Welcome to neuroccm.org. This site is dedicated to fostering learning, discussion, and interest in all things neurocritical care/critical care in addition to topics related to fields such stroke. Areas of interests are stroke, status epilepticus (SE), and EEG in the ICU setting. Regarding SE, I am specifically interested in New-onset Refractory Status Epilepticus (NORSE).  I am also interested in the computational advances being made that utilize deep learning and thus hope to write some material about this topic as well and how it relates to neurophysiology, critical care, and stroke care.

Links, topics, and posts discussed on this site are by no means the end-all or definitive write-up of a topic and do not reflect anything other than personal opinion and perspective of a critical care physician/neuroscientist. If you are interest in contributing to neuroccm.org as a contributing author for future blog posts, then please contact me: houman[at]ccmd[dot]io

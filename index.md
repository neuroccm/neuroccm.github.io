Welcome to [ncrit.org/neuroccm.org](https://ncrit.org) by Houman Khosravani. This site is a work in development and dedicated to fostering interest and discussion about topics in stroke, neurocritical care, critical care. My academic areas of interest are Quality Improvement in Stroke, and overlap with Neurocritical Care (such as care of the post-TPA and EVT patient). In the ICU my interest lies in *status epilepticus* and continuous EEG (cEEG). Regarding *status epilepticus*, I am specifically interested in [New-onset Refractory Status Epilepticus (NORSE)](https://norseinstitute.org).  I am also interested in the computational advances being made that utilize machine learning and thus hope to write some material about this topic as well and how it relates to EEG analysis/neurophysiology, critical care, and stroke medicine.

Welcome to neuroccm.org [ncrit.org], by Houman Khosravani. This site is gradually in development and dedicated to fostering interest and discussion about topics in stroke and neurocritical care. My specific areas of interest are acute stroke management and EEG in the ICU, specifically status epilepticus (SE) and NORSE [New-onset Refractory Status Epilepticus (NORSE)](https://norseinstitute.org). My academic focus is quality improvement in acute stroke care. Scientifically I'm passionate about applying advances in computer science (data science, visualization, machine learning) to quality improvement in stroke and neurocritical care in addition to multimodal data such as cEEG.

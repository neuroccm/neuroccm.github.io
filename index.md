Welcome to [ncrit.org/neuroccm.org](https://ncrit.org) by Dr. Houman Khosravani (Assistant Professor, Division of Neurology, University of Toronto). This is the lab's website and dedicated to providing information on active projects, fostering interest in our lab's clinical neuroscience projects that focus on quality improvement in acute stroke care, neurocritical care, and neuropalliative care.

Our lab's academic areas of interest are Quality Improvement in acute Stroke, and where it overlaps with Neurocritical Care. A focus of my research are human performance factors and the implementation of crisis resource management in stroke. We are working on door-to-needle times and leveraging this QI work to enhance acute stroke care pathways for all door-to-intervention metrics - specifically the human performance factors through code stroke simulation. My academic group is also engaged in medical education for stroke patient, we have a podcast Stroke FM, and are focused on knowledge translation using multimedia and simulation. Two additional areas of special interest are using machine learning to improve stroke care and the utilization of palliative care in the acute stroke setting. My critical care interest are continuous EEG (cEEG) in a clinical neurosciences environment.

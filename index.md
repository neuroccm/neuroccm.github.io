Welcome to neuroccm.org [ncrit.org], by Houman Khosravani. This site is gradually in development and dedicated to fostering interest and discussion about topics in stroke and neurocritical care. My specific areas of interest are acute stroke management and EEG in the ICU, specifically status epilepticus (SE) and NORSE [New-onset Refractory Status Epilepticus (NORSE)](https://norseinstitute.org). My academic focus is quality improvement in acute stroke care. Scientifically I'm passionate about applying advances in computer science (data science, visualization, machine learning) to quality improvement in stroke and neurocritical care in addition to multimodal data such as cEEG.

Links, topics, and posts discussed on this site are by no means the end-all or definitive write-up of a topic and do not reflect anything other than personal opinion and perspective (of a critical care physician/neuroscientist). If you are interest in collaborating or contributing to neuroccm.org as a contributing author - please contact me: houman[at]ccmd[dot]io

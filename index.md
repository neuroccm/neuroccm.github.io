Welcome to [ncrit.org/neuroccm.org](https://ncrit.org) by Dr. Houman Khosravani (Assistant Professor, Division of Neurology, University of Toronto). This is the lab's website and dedicated to providing information on active projects, fostering interest in our lab's clinical neuroscience project, which deal with quality of care improvement in acute stroke, neuro-palliative care, neurocritical care and critical care EEG.

My academic areas of interest are Quality Improvement in Stroke, and overlap with Neurocritical Care (such as care of the post-TPA and EVT patient). A focus of my research are human performance factors and the implementation of crisis resource management in stroke. I am working on door-to-needle times and leveraging this QI work to enhance acute stroke care pathways for all door-to-intervention metrics. My academic group is also engaged in medical education around code strokes, specifically knowledge translationa and dissemination using simulations for code strokes. My critical care interest are continuous EEG (cEEG) and  *status epilepticus*. Regarding *status epilepticus*, I am specifically interested in [New-onset Refractory Status Epilepticus (NORSE)](https://norseinstitute.org).  In addition I am building collaborations and seeking collaborators interested in computational advances using machine learning as applied to the delivery of care in acute stroke and neurocritical care, in addition to signal processing of EEG.

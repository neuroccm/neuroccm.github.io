Welcome to the Stroke Innovations Lab (SiLab), led by Dr. Khosravani. The SiLab, nestled within the Division of Neurology at the University of Toronto, is dedicated to Quality Improvement (QI) in acute stroke care. Our primary areas of focus is to providfe maximal effective care in hyperacute stroke - our areas of focus are: are medical simulation for stroke resuscitation, integration of palliative care within stroke treatment, and utilizing AI to enhance QI within stroke care.

SiLab champions the application of crisis resource management and stroke simulation to optimize critical intervention metrics such as "door-to-needle" times. Proud to be pioneers in the field, we published the first reframe of Crisis Resource Management (CRM) for stroke care, illustrating our relentless pursuit of knowledge and improvement. This also includes development of the "protected code stroke" during the COVID19 pandemic, which was integrated into national and international guidelines, and downloaded over 25K from AHA's website.

Our research aims to enhance care pathways and human performance factors for acute stroke patients through medical simulation. We are also exploring the intersection of machine learning and quality improvement, utilizing voice-based technologies to refine our methods.

Despite significant advancements in stroke care, a considerable number of patients still grapple with substantial morbidity and mortality. Recognizing this, we advocate for the routine integration of palliative care into stroke treatment. Compassionate and effective care forms the bedrock of our approach to patient wellness, thus we are continually studying the confluence of palliative medicine and stroke care.

Our lab is also passionate about medical education. We host StrokeFM, a podcast dedicated to sharing knowledge on stroke care through multimedia and web-based technologies. Also, we offer a wealth of resources through our simulation support website, silab.ca.

We have introduced the concept of "neurovascular resuscitation," applying principles from medical and trauma resuscitation to stroke treatment - thereby reinstating the 'code' in code stroke.

Our pursuit of excellence extends to the cutting-edge field of machine learning. Collaborating with T-CAIREM and SHSC, we are leveraging bedside physiologic recordings to improve the quality of acute stroke care.

We are proud to have founded several initiatives, including the Neurology Quality and Innovations Lab (NQIL), in collaboration with Drs. Sara Mitchell and Charles Kassardjian, and the Stroke FM Podcast, the official podcast of the Canadian Stroke Consortium. In addition, Dr. Khosravani and Dr. Christine Hawkes co-founded the Neurovascular Innovations CollaborativE (NICE), an initiative projected to contribute substantially to augmenting neurovascular care education.

Dr. Khosravani helms the medical/neurocritical care efforts within NICE, while Dr. Hawkes helms the neurovascular and catheter-based aspects of hyperacute care and techniques.

Dr. Khosravani's Stroke Innovation Lab, also known as SiLab, is centered on Quality Improvement (QI) in acute stroke care, which is conducted under the Division of Neurology at the University of Toronto. The lab focuses on the implementation of crisis resource management and stroke simulation to improve "door-to-needle" times and other door-to-intervention metrics. The work is aimed at enhancing care pathways and human performance factors for acute stroke patients through simulation. The lab also leverages machine learning for QI in addition to how it applies to not only acute stroke but also palliative care in the context of stroke.

The lab is actively involved in medical education, featuring a podcast called StrokeFM. This podcast is dedicated to disseminating knowledge about stroke care, using multimedia and web-based technologies.

The lab is also engaged in cutting-edge research in machine learning, where they leverage bedside physiologic recordings to enhance acute stroke care quality. This work is carried out in affiliation with T-CAIREM and SHSC.

In collaboration with Dr. Christine Hawkes, Dr. Khosravani co-founded the Neurovascular Innovations CollaborativE (NICE). Although the details are yet to be shared, it's anticipated that NICE will contribute significantly to their mission.

In terms of neurocritical care, Dr. Khosravani has a particular interest in human factors, continuous EEG (cEEG).

Our lab has coined the term "neurovascular resuscitation" translating concepts from medical and trauma resusciation to stroke.

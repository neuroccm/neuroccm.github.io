Welcome to the Stroke Innovations / AI4QI Lab in Stroke, Dr. Khosravani's lab site, as part of the Division of Neurology at the University of Toronto. Our lab's work is dedicated to Quality Improvement (QI) in acute stroke care. Our area of focus is to provide maximal effective care in hyperacute stroke. We are focusing on 3 core areas: 1) stroke resuscitation by facilitating education and QI using simulation and a CRM framework for resuscitation in stroke., 2) we are passionate about providing maximal effective care and that includes integration of palliative care within stroke treatment, and 3) we are leveraging machine-learning to enhance QI within stroke care. Dr. Khosravani also hosts the Stroke FM Podcast, the official podcast of the Canadian Stroke Consortium.

**Neurovascular Resuscitation - Neurovascular Innovations CollaborativE (NICE)**
* Our lab championed the framework of crisis resource management in stroke simulation to optimize critical intervention metrics such as "door-to-needle" times. We are proud to be pioneers in the field and we published the first reframe of Crisis Resource Management (CRM) for stroke care care. We alsp developed the "protected code stroke" during the COVID19 pandemic, which was integrated into national and international guidelines, and downloaded over 27K times from the American Heart Association, Stroke journal's website. Our research aims to enhance care pathways and human performance factors for acute stroke patients through simulation of neurovascular resuscitation. We have introduced the concept of "neurovascular resuscitation," applying principles from medical and trauma resuscitation to stroke treatment - thereby reinstating the 'code' in code stroke.
* Dr. Khosravani and Dr. Christine Hawkes co-founded the Neurovascular Innovations CollaborativE (NICE), an initiative projected to contribute substantially to augmenting neurovascular care education.
* Our lab's portion of focus is the medical/neurocritical care efforts within NICE, while Dr. Hawkes helms the neurovascular and catheter-based aspects of hyperacute care and techniques.

**Artificial Intelligence 4 QI (AI4QI) and the Neurology Quality and Innovations Lab (NQIL)**
* We are also exploring the intersection of machine learning and quality improvement, utilizing voice-based technologies to refine our methods.
* Our pursuit of excellence extends to the cutting-edge field of machine learning. Collaborating with T-CAIREM and SHSC, we are leveraging bedside physiologic recordings to improve the quality of acute stroke care.
* We are proud to have founded several initiatives, including the Neurology Quality and Innovations Lab (NQIL), in collaboration with Drs. Sara Mitchell and Charles Kassardjian.

**Routine Integration of Palliative Care in Stroke**
* Despite significant advancements in stroke care, a considerable number of patients still grapple with substantial morbidity and mortality. Recognizing this, we advocate for the routine integration of palliative care into stroke treatment. Compassionate and effective care forms the bedrock of the philosophy we advocate for in terms of expanding the confluence of palliative medicine and stroke care.

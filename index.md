Welcome to [ncrit.org/neuroccm.org](https://ncrit.org) by Houman Khosravani. This site is a work in development and dedicated to fostering interest and discussion about topics in stroke, neurocritical care, critical care. My academic areas of interest are Quality Improvement in Stroke, and overlap with Neurocritical Care (such as care of the post-TPA and EVT patient). In the ICU my interest lies in *status epilepticus* and continuous EEG (cEEG). Regarding *status epilepticus*, I am specifically interested in [New-onset Refractory Status Epilepticus (NORSE)](https://norseinstitute.org).  I am also interested in the computational advances being made that utilize machine learning and thus hope to write some material about this topic as well and how it relates to EEG analysis/neurophysiology, critical care, and stroke medicine.

Links, topics, and posts discussed on this site are by no means the end-all or definitive write-up of a topic and do not reflect anything other than personal opinion and perspective (of a critical care physician/neuroscientist). If you are interest in collaborating or contributing to neuroccm.org as a contributing author - please contact me: houman[at]ccmd[dot]io

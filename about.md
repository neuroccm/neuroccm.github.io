# About neuroccm.org | ncrit.org #

neuroccm.org is a resource site and blog developed by Houman Khosravani MD MSc PhD FRCPC. The aim of neuroccm.org is to enhance learning and discussion around topics related to intensive care and neurointesive care. In addition this site aims to foster and develop the application to modern computational techniques applicable to big data as they apply to neurocritical care and critical care medicine.

I also have an interest in education in the ICU and have developed the on-line educational portal for both Western University and University of Toronto Critical Care. These both utilize Google's G-Suite for educational purposes and Google Classroom (App-based mobile learning platform). Please see my education website: [ecriticalcare.org](http://ecriticalcare.org){:target="_blank"} and [torontocriticalcare.org](http://torontocriticalcare.org){:target="_blank"}.
For more information on how this was developed, please see: [Resident Education using a Cloud-based Mobile App in a Flipped Classroom](/manuscripts/Khosravani_Scholar_Project_Public.pdf){:target="_blank"}

# Houman Khosravani, MD PhD FRCPC #

I am an internist/intensivist with a passion for neurocritical care and general critical care. I also have an interest in applying computational techniques in the ICU setting.

I completed my MSc in neuroscience/physiology at the University of Toronto, and combined MD/PhD training at the University of Calgary, with a PhD in Neuroscience. My MSc and PhD utilized nonlinear systems theory and computational biology as applied to understanding seizure generation at the single cell and neuronal network level. The focus was on understanding the generation of abnormal neuronal network synchrony. I then entered Neurology training at the University of Toronto for PGY1 and PGY2 before transitioning to Internal Medicine at the same institution. I completed my my PGY4 and PGY5 training in (adult) Critical Care Medicine at Western University. I completed a fellowship in Neurocritical Care (advisor/supervisor: Dr. Martin Chapman) and ICU EEG (advisor/supervisor: Dr. Bryan Young) at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, University of Toronto. I will be starting a focused stroke fellowship in Oct. 2017 as a Clinical Associate (Attending Staff) within Neurology at Sunnybrook Health Sciences upon completion of this training. In addition, I practice Internal Medicine/Critical Care at Cambridge Memorial Hospital and Internal Medicine at Southlake Regional Health Centre.

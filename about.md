# About neuroccm.org | ncrit.org #

neuroccm.org is a resource site, blog site, and personal landing page, developed by Houman Khosravani MD MSc PhD FRCPC. The aim of neuroccm.org is to enhance learning and discussion around topics related to intensive care, neurointesive care. Specific topics related to neurointensive care and of particular interest within neurology include neurovascular topics, and status epilepticus.

I have an interest in medical education. In the ICU setting, I have developed the on-line educational portal for both Western University and University of Toronto's Critical Care programs. These both utilize Google's educational platform that uses web-based and App-based modalities. Please see these web portals and sites for further info: [ecriticalcare.org](ecriticalcare.org) and [torontocriticalcare.org](torontocriticalcare.org). For more information on how this was developed, from a scholar project during my critical care training, please see this document: [Resident Education using a Cloud-based Mobile App in a Flipped Classroom](/manuscripts/Khosravani_Scholar_Project_Public.pdf)

# Houman Khosravani, MD PhD FRCPC #

I completed my MSc in Physiology (neuroscience) at the University of Toronto with Dr. Peter Carlen. My MSc work focused on computational neuroscience, specifically time-series analysis and the application of nonlinear systems theory to anticipating and controlling seizures using electrical stimuli.

My PhD is in Neuroscience, labs of Dr. G. Zamponi and P. Federico. The focus of my work was on understanding the generation of abnormal neuronal activity and synchrony (at both cellular and neuronal network levels) in the context of normal physiology and that of epileptic seizures. My PhD had three areas of focus leading to the following findings:
* Exploring and defining the functional role of T-type Calcium Channel mutations in Primary Generalized Epilepsy. We showed that several of these SNPs had functional consequences that resulted in a gain of function and increased putative neuronal excitability.
* We discovered an interaction between endogenous prion protein and NMDA receptors as a mechanism of excitotoxic neuronal death and hyperexcitability.
* Defining the role of high-frequency oscillations in intracranial EEG recordings of patients with epilepsy, as precursors to the ictal onset zone both temporally and spatially.

After graduate work and medical school I entered Neurology training at the University of Toronto for PGY1 and PGY2 before transitioning to Internal Medicine at the same institution. I completed my my PGY4 and PGY5 training in (adult) Critical Care Medicine (Western University). I completed a fellowship in Neurocritical Care (Sunnybrook Health Science, University of Toronto) as well as ICU EEG (supervisor: Dr. Bryan Young) in June 2017. I will be starting a focused stroke fellowship and working as a Clinical Associate stroke physician at Sunnybrook Health Sciences, University of Toronto in Oct. 2017. I am on staff for Internal Medicine/Critical Care at Cambridge Memorial Hospital and Internal Medicine at Southlake Regional Health Centre.

# About neuroccm.org | ncrit.org #

neuroccm.org is a resource site and blog developed by Houman Khosravani MD MSc PhD FRCPC. The aim of neuroccm.org is to enhance learning and discussion around topics related to intensive care and neurointesive care. In addition this site aims to foster and develop the application to modern computational techniques applicable to big data as they apply to neurocritical care and critical care medicine.

I also have an interest in education in the ICU and have developed the on-line educational portal for both Western University and University of Toronto. These both utilize Google's G-Suite for educational purposes and Google Classroom. Please see my education website: [ecriticalcare.org][ecriticalcare] and [torontocriticalcare.org][torontocriticalcare].

# Houman Khosravani, MD PhD FRCPC #

I am an internist/intensivist with a passion for neurocritical care and general critical care. I also have an interest in applying computational techniques to "big data" in the ICU setting.

I completed my MSc in neuroscience/physiology at the University of Toronto, and combined MD/PhD training at the University of Calgary, with a PhD in Neuroscience. My MSc and PhD utilized nonlinear systems theory and computational biology as applied to understanding seizure generation at the single cell and neuronal network level. The focus was on understanding the generation of abnormal neuronal network synchrony. I then entered Neurology training at the University of Toronto for 2 years before transitioning to Internal Medicine at the same institution. I recently completed my adult Critical Care Medicine fellowship at Western University, in London Ontario.

I am an Adjunct Professor at Western University, Department of Medicine, Division of Critical Care. I am pursuing additional training in neurocritical care at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in affiliation with the University of Toronto. I practice general medicine at Southlake Regional Health Centre and critical care medicine at the University of Western Ontario and also Cambridge Memorial Hospital.
